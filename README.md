# KeyAuth Seller Panel.

>Ok so after some hard thinking iv decided to stop developing this project.
What i am going to do instead is make a cross platform project instead.
What does this mean ?
Cross platform = Android, IOS, and Windows.
So my new project will work on most the devices you wont, all managed from one project.

This project is not finished but in a state for you guys to use and test, compile the code yourself or use the release and just run it.
It will be receiving a lot of updates and changes over time.
Please report any issues/bugs/ideas to me.
